## Installation 
for linux users who uses VSCode to run these two modules 
first create a virtual environment -> 1) python -m venv venv 2) source venv/bin/activate
Or inside the working directory install -> 1) sudo apt install python-virtualenv/ sudo pacman -S python-virtualenv 2) virtualenv venv 3) source venv/bin/activate

psutils and rich modules are highly useful when it comes to customizing terminal output and internal device and local network scanning.
hashing, webbrowser, and ipaddress are prebuilt python packages no external installation needed. I kind of liked how websites handshakes with users via cryptography, browsing websites with code, and global network structure. There is much more information hidden inside!
